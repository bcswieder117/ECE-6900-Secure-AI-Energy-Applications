# ECE 6900: Secure AI-Driven Energy Applications 

This was a special topics course for Spring 2026 and will contain all work done in this course. 

**Course Description**: This interdisciplinary course explores the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity, and 
energy systems, equipping students with both foundational knowledge and convergence insights. 
Participants will study core concepts of AI and machine learning, principles of cybersecurity, and 
the modern energy systems, including smart grids and renewable integration. Through case studies, 
group-based hands-on projects, and research-driven discussions, students will gain the skills to 
analyze, design, and secure AI-driven energy applications. Students will work in team and propose 
a semester long project integrating the technologies in AI, cybersecurity and energy. Key 
milestones will be defined by the team, and capstone-style final project presentations will be 
required.
